+++
As I've been learning how to learn in my Natural Science Education (NSED) course, I wanted to relate this Bloom's Taxonomy exercise to my Korean learning. Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework to categorize educational goals. I've taken these top level categories, and created my own subcategories to identify how I can approach my goal.

* **Remember**
  * recognizing learned words from a Korean video or song
  * be able to read learned words and recall them
* **Understand**
  * know the meaning of the words I've learned
  * compare words and classify them into general groups
* **Apply**
  * use learned phrases to create new phrases
  * combine different phrases to create a sentence
* **Analyze**
  * recognize grammar patterns and break them down into nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, miscellaneous particles
  * distinguish grammar and spelling exceptions, and store separate rules for them
* **Evaluate**
  * prioritize what information will be learned and kept
  * judge the effectiveness of sentences and how they are conveyed
* **Create**
  * build novel sentences to complete fully formed thoughts
  * language becomes fully under control, can communicate freely
