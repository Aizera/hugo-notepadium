As I'm reaching closer and closer to the finale of the game, I've grown a neat little collection of titles, levels, power-ups, and everything in between.

#### An 100-day Adventure! A Couch Potato No Longer.

#### Training Together

My sister has also been keeping up with ring fit almost as much as I have. As Woody Allen says, just showing up is half the battle. It's relatively convenient if one of us plays first, and all the cons set up for the other player. although she has been focusing more towards completing the adventure mode before backtracking to complete the side quests, while I've opted to do side quests along the way. 

#### So... any criticism on Ring Fit at all? Yes.

As satisfying as the main story mode may be, the "acquire perfect" minigame missions really do tilt me. One of the biggest offenders is the "smack back" minigame, which you have to hold the ring con as a giant fan, and basically smack the discs the robots throw at you. As simple as that may sound, the ring con's detection of where my arms are is quite weak, and it would constantly reset to the center even if I did not swing back, basically throwing me off.
