It's been about a month since my last Ring Fit Adventure post, but yes, I am still wading through the levels at a steady pace, occasionally backtracking to finish my side quests. For my friends who showed some interest in trying out Ring Fit for real, this one is for you! I want to talk about how I got started and how I kept going.

## How I got myself to fully commit to Ring Fit Adventure

#### Gaming Aspect

Personally, if Ring Fit wasn't a game, my consideration to incorporate fitness into my life still might not have been a thing. For me, Ring Fit is one of the many games I am inherently interested in, and I am willing to put in the work to grind stats and progress in the game. The story is interesting enough for me, and the music battle always gets me pumped up! Here is my absolute favorite OST from the game below, feel free to listen if you don't mind the spoiler!

#### Easy Entry

Ring Fit's easy barrier to entry is also one way that got me to start. Ring Fit has a custom intensity scale from 1 to 30, which will determine how much damage you can do per attack. This difficulty of exercise intensity is fully controlled by the user, and is independent of the difficulty of the game. I began with a level 6, which was giving me 4-10 reps to complete an attack, and I've slowly raised it to 8, 10, then a jump to 15, which now has around 10-20 reps to complete an attack depending on the pose (except Yoga poses).

#### Redirecting my Energy

Because I am stuck at home in the middle of the global pandemic, my normal movement of walking up and down the hill on the campus, or shopping and walking around the neighborhood has ceased to be. That gave me a chance to redirect all the effort I've been putting in to a slightly more intense and purposeful workout. Because I can decide that I want to work out for when and how long, I only push myself to do slightly more than the point I can withstand. That's why I am able to maintain the hobby consistently by giving myself the right amount of challenge as I grow with the game.

## Bonus: FAQ/Concerns

* Q: I'm concerned that I will make a lot of noise jogging.
* A: Ring Fit has a silent mode, where you have to bounce your body to jog instead of actually jogging.
* Q: Are there any accessibility options?
* A: As per Ring Fit's philosophy, you should only work out at the range of your own ability. If you need help, the game has an assist mode that you can activate for different parts of the body. For example, as a contrast to the silent mode which requires bouncing your legs, the knee assist would permit you to not jog at all.

Below is a video by [VIVY Has A Dream Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW8DUDPsmQ4) showing how assist mode is used.

* Q: Is there a multiplayer mode?
* A: There isn't simultaneous multiplayer, but my sister and I take turns playing, and we can compare stats locally.
* Q: Does the game get boring for you?
* A: I would say that is subjective! I personally play a lot of grindy RPGs, like Pokemon, Maplestory, and Battle Chasers: Night War. If you fancy those types of games, I'd say you are set.
