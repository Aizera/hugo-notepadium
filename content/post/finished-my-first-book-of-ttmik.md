![](https://dwz4645vtyxp6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/28162606/books_02.jpg)I took a one month break from learning Korean <!--more--> (and also blogging about what I'm doing), but I finally finished the first out of the 7 books I bought of the "Talk to Me in Korean" series. I'm glad I still got the groove going and I haven't just ejected everything from my mind like I do for basically all other academic subjects. So, that's good at least.

Currently, I'm still on the "[remember](https://aizera.netlify.app/post/bloom-s-taxonomy-exercise/ "Bloom's Taxonomy Exercise")" stage, pointing out things I've learned in videos and music. I flipped through a few lessons of the second book, but it already seems quite intimidating. I constantly think of how on earth I digested all that English grammar (considering it's my second subject), but now that I think of it, I probably didn't. I just let myself make mistakes all the time.
