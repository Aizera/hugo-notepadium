Ike first met her patron in a dream.

She finds herself suspended in the depths of an ocean; there is not a hint of sunlight nor a sign of life.

She lifts her body upright to observe her surroundings, and is drawn in by a resonating, booming noise from a nearby cave. Two giant eyes: each eye five times greater than her body, open to greet her. Both eyes illuminate a dark tangerine hue.

Their eyes meet.

Suddenly, she seems to no longer be able to breathe. An abundant mass of water gushes into her nose and mouth; she drowns.

Finally awoken from her dream, she fiercely sits up on her bed. Her entire body is drenched in sweat, and she finds herself unable to draw a proper breath. It feels as if she had perished in a gruesome manner, and miraculously returned back to life. As the days went on, she begins to discover a tinge of energy imbued in the core of her body.

It is her first taste of power.
