When there is such a thin line between workspace and gaming table, it's kind of a pain for me to get into "work mode" and just spend countless hours playing games. <!--more-->I don't really remember the last time I was intrinsically motivated to try hard with schoolwork, but being cooped up at home kind of makes it worse.

I am taking summer courses, so it definitely feels like my summer is not summer. I'm still tied to obligations, and my work comes off quite sloppy and lacking in quality. I know it, professors/TAs probably know it as well.

Gonna leave this run-on thought with a comic of what I really wanted this quarantine life to be instead, but there's just so much to do. Damn, I'm jealous of this cat.
