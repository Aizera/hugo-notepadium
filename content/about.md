Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Kate. I'm a full time student and digital art hobbyist who spend most of my time on procrastinating and getting distracted by things.

I'll be posting my progress on digital painting, reading, gaming and other miscellaneous things.

### FAQ

**Still doing Ring Fit?** I'm definitely still going steady, I am on NG++ :) 

**Still learning Korean?** I took a little break but I still look up stuff from time to time. Might get back into it in summer.

**How much does it cost to keep this blog?** It costs me around $10/year to keep the 'aizera.page' domain and I bought it on Porkbun. I use Github + Netlify + Forestry, and all three of those services are free for personal use.

**Are you going to make money from this blog?** Highly unlikely. There are a lot of people out there selling the dream that being a blogger for a living is possible, but people who sell those dreams make money of off people who fantasize about going big with a blog. It's like a fisherman teaching fish how to get worms, but only if you bite the hook first.
